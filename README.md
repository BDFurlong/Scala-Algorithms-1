Scala-Algorithms
===============

I wanted to see what some of Robert Sedgewick's Algorithms written in Java would look like and how 
they perform in Scala. 

This is mainly a learning exercise but I hope will provide useful examples eventually.
 
I start out with the closest thing that works, very imperative and using nulls the same as in 
Java. I intend to make it more functional and test how that affects performance. I hope it will
reveal where tradeoffs are between imperative and functional techniques.
